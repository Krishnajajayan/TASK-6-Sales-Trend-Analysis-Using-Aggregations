#  Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations (SQLite via Python)

##  Objective

Analyze monthly revenue and order volume using SQL queries executed via SQLite in Python. This analysis is based on the "Sample - Superstore.csv" dataset.

---

##  Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- SQLite (via `sqlite3` library)
- SQL for data aggregation and trend analysis

---

##  Dataset

The dataset contains order-related information, including:
- **Order Date**: Date when the order was placed
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order
- **Sales**: Revenue generated by the order

This information is sufficient to extract and aggregate sales trends.

---

##  Task Breakdown

### a. Extract Month from `Order Date`

Extract the month component from the `Order Date` to analyze monthly trends.

---

### b. Group By Year and Month

Group the data by both year and month to distinguish trends over time.

---

### c. Calculate Total Revenue per Month

Compute total monthly revenue using SQL aggregation functions.

---

### d. Count Distinct Order Volume per Month

Calculate the number of unique orders placed each month to assess sales volume.

---

### e. Order Results by Year and Month

Sort the results chronologically by year and month to view the progression of sales trends.

---

### f. Filter for Specific Time Period

Limit the analysis to a specific year or range of months to focus on particular business periods.

---

##  Outcome

By completing this task, you will:

- Learn how to extract date components using SQL
- Understand how to group and summarize time-series data
- Be able to analyze business performance month-over-month
- Practice sorting and filtering datasets based on time

---

##  Notes

- SQLite’s `strftime()` function is used instead of `EXTRACT()` for date parts.
- This project works entirely in-memory using SQLite through Python—no permanent database setup is required.

---

##  Extension Idea

You can visualize the results using a plotting library like `matplotlib` or `seaborn` to present the trends more clearly.
